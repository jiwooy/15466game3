# Turn on the lights!

Author: Jiwoo Yoo

Design: You're trapped in a dark maze, and all you want to do is turn on the lights.
But there's some one else in the maze too, and they don't want the lights on. Find
all the generators before they get you. Luckily, neither they nor the generators are
very quiet...
